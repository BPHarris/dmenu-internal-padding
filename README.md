# dmenu-internal-padding


# Description

A [dmenu patch](https://suckless.org/hacking) to allow for the addition of internal padding to the elements of [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu). This is the dmenu equivalent to [dwm-internal-bar-padding](https://github.com/bpharris/dwm-internal-bar-padding).

Padding is controled by the variables `barvpadpx` and `barhpadpx` in the user's config header. The former is applied as both the left *and* right padding of each element, and the latter as the top *and* bottom padding.
